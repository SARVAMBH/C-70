                <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep and happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

The concept of hidden village is to recreate how it would be like living inside a real forest, without its wild side, yet with all the basic comforts of a home under the green canopy, serviced by local villagers. Good for authentic nature lovers.What Hidden Village is not? While the above is true, these are compact rooms, unlike the huge spacious hotel rooms with fancy décor, adhering to minimalism. It’s not a water park like environment although it has two water bodies. It’s very unlike the regular resorts.A Village So Hidden, Even Google Doesn’t Know It!</p>

Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive.

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block. In 2015, they established the LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre in order to research other options for its product and packaging. “There is no common definition of a sustainable material. Several factors influence the environmental sustainability of a material – the composition of the material, how it is sourced and what happens when the product reaches the end of its life. When we search for new materials all of these factors must be considered,” said Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, CEO and President of the LEGO Group. One material that has been floated as a possible alternative has been hemp. 420 Magazine motivated in their article that hemp could be a good.</p>
